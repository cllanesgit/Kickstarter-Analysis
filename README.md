Kickstarter-Analysis Report

OverView

In this project I reviewed, added, and altered data based on the client's needs. This included the addition of filters, data tables and charts such as line charts and pivot tablets, and extra data based on Kickstarter goals. In this analysis, I went over values based on theater/plays to give a better insight on both data sets. 

Analysis and Challenges

This analysis was made possible through Excel functions, charts, and tables. I wanted to at one point add automations (macros) but I did not feel I am yet fluent enough at VBA, so I refrained from doing so as to not accidentally negatively alter the integrity of the data. I used all the knowledge and practice I had with previous Excel topics to make sure all data provided was fully valid. I did encounter some challenges with functions I was not very familiar with due to low usage in every-day activities such as the countifs function. This function along with the Years() function was challenging to me due to all the conditionals that had to be used at the same time and the fact that the date was in Unix format, something I had never worked with before. However, I did my fair bit of research and pushed through most of this successfully. 

Conclusion

The second to third quartile was definitely the most active when it came to theater/plays. Both, successful and failed outcomes were higher than the rest of the year by ~56% more; however, more than twice seemed to be successful. The most successful month was definitely the month of May with 111 theater/plays being successful. Regardless of what the goal was, it seemed that they received the most funding based on what the general public was most interested on. Some had very low goals, while some had very high goals, and yet, it did not make much of the differences when it came to the numbers, they seemed to have had an equal opportunity to either fair to succeed. Some limitations of this dataset is that, it's hard to see what people are exactly interested on when it comes to genre of play or general market strategies used to achieve their goal. The data provided is a simple true or false, success or fail situation data in which much of the rest of the data was not used to provide this analysis. When it comes to extra data tables or charts, I actually created a bar charts that perfectly represents the data for the outcomes based on launch. If used properly, other charts to provide other angles of the data could be used like a pie chart.
